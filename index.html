                    <p class="body">My name is Nick, and I’m an Economics & Business student at the University of Waterloo. I’m curious by nature and driven by learning. I love playing the guitar, Indonesian food, and anything related to finance. I also enjoy getting lost in fiction, where my imagination has room to wander. That love of learning is what inspired me to build this site. I’m a firm believer in lifelong growth.
                    <br><br>Outside of academics, I’m a varsity athlete on the university’s Track and Field team, specializing in long jump (current PB: 6.74 m). I play a mix of sports, including volleyball, basketball, and soccer. I enjoy staying active, and I hope that I can keep on playing sports throughout my lifetime.
                    <br><br>I also run the UW Public Speaking Club, where I get to share my love of storytelling with the UW community. We host weekly workshops built around games, discussion, and real practice. It’s less like a classroom and more like a community. You can check out what we’re up to on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uwpublicspeaking?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">Instagram.</a>

                        <p class="body">Funny enough, I actually started at UW playing varsity football. I later transitioned over to track and field because I wanted to learn how to bet on myself. Varsity taught me the importance of discipline and hard work. I learned that progress isn't made in the spotlight, but rather when nobody is watching. Those days where I didn't feel like going to train, yet still showed up, helped shaped my character. </p>

                        <p class="body">One of my first co-ops was at Definity. Here, I learned how to work within systems. I found ways to optimize existing workflows, and put my own personal touch on these improvements. I leveraged AI to speed our work up, revamped the KPI file, and created a "Co-Op Bible" that served as a guide for future co-ops. I also learned so much from those around me. It goes to show that there is so much to learn from others, and many stories to be heard.</p>

Knocking on strangers' doors for the first time trying to sell something was like telling a 5-year old to do a double backflip. It was terrifying at first, but we eventually became more confident. I learned how to pitch effectively and pursuasively during my time running the business. I worked with a small team, and taught sales pitches on the frontend, and managed the cash on the backend. It was my first stint at running my own business.</p>
