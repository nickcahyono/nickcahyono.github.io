                    <p class="body">My name is Nick, and I’m an Economics & Business student at the University of Waterloo. I’m curious by nature and driven by learning. I love playing the guitar, Indonesian food, and anything related to finance. I also enjoy getting lost in fiction, where my imagination has room to wander. That love of learning is what inspired me to build this site. I’m a firm believer in lifelong growth.
                    <br><br>Outside of academics, I’m a varsity athlete on the university’s Track and Field team, specializing in long jump (current PB: 6.74 m). I play a mix of sports, including volleyball, basketball, and soccer. I enjoy staying active, and I hope that I can keep on playing sports throughout my lifetime.
                    <br><br>I also run the UW Public Speaking Club, where I get to share my love of storytelling with the UW community. We host weekly workshops built around games, discussion, and real practice. It’s less like a classroom and more like a community. You can check out what we’re up to on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uwpublicspeaking?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">Instagram.</a>

                        <p class="body">I stepped into this role to really test my leadership. I built the club’s framework, helped shape its culture, and worked closely with a team of nine students to bring it to life. Running a club taught me that leadership is about consistency and clarity. I’m still learning what kind of leader I am, but I’m sharpening that understanding every week.</p>

                        <p class="body">I started at UW as a varsity football player and later switched to track because I wanted to bet on myself. Track taught me discipline in its purest form. I learned that progress doesn’t happen in the spotlight, but rather on the days you don’t feel like training and still show up. That habit of showing up has shaped my mindset well beyond sport. </p>

                        <p class="body">At Definity, I learned how to work within real systems and improve them without breaking what already worked. I streamlined workflows, used AI to speed up recurring tasks, revamped a KPI file, and built a guide to help future co-ops ramp faster. I also learned a lot from the people around me. Strong teams raise your standard quickly.</p>

I learned how to pitch clearly, handle rejection, and stay calm under pressure. I coached sales on the front end, managed cash on the back end, and got my first real taste of building something from nothing.</p>
